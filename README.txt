Python is your perfect companion to take the 111 days of code challenge and be successful.This course is for anyone who wants to immerse themselves in Python for 111 days worth of learning and hands-on projects. We donâ€™t start from absolute zero in terms of programming but if you are new to Python we have a language appendix and we start somewhat slow. By the end of the course, we get into intermediate-level Python projects.
